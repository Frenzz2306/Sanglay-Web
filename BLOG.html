        <p>Starting out in Introduction to Computing with little knowledge can feel intimidating.  At first, it may seem daunting, filled with technical terms, complex processes, and abstract concepts. However, the experience of learning something entirely new, especially in a field as influential and exciting as computing, is both empowering and rewarding.</p>
        <p>I Have difficulty is understanding how everything connects. For beginners, the relationship between code, the computer, and the final output isn’t always clear. Simple mistakes, like missing a semicolon, can lead to errors that feel impossible to fix with limited knowledge.</p>
        <p>However, embarking on the journey of learning computing without prior knowledge is a transformative experience. It teaches not just technical skills but also critical thinking, problem-solving, and perseverance. While the road may be challenging at times, the rewards—both in terms of personal growth and the ability to contribute to a technology-driven world—are immense. With determination, resources, and a willingness to learn, anyone can navigate the digital landscape and discover the endless possibilities of computing.</p>
